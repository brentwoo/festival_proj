Minimum parts:

* Phone set
* Token processing rules (numbers etc)
* Prosodic phrasing method
* Word pronunciation (lexicon and/or letter-to-sound rules)
* Intonation (accents and F0 contour)
* Durations
* Waveform synthesizer

> The general method for defining a new voice is to define the parameters for all the various sub-parts e.g. phoneset, duration parameter intonation parameters etc., then defined a function of the form voice_NAME which when called will actually select the voice.

> Voice name convention
> institution name _ ISO _ speaker initials
> (e.g., cmu_us_awb)

## Requirements

Along with Festival and the Edinburgh Speech Tools, you will need [festvox](http://www.festvox.org/download.html).




## Phone set

An example can be seen in `festival/lib/radio_phones.scm`.

Select an alternate phone set with the command `PhoneSet.select`.

Here is a budding Spanish phone set example, with just two vowels (the phone '#' is silence):

    (defPhoneSet
      spanish
      ;;;  Phone Features
      (;; vowel or consonant
       (vc + -)  
       ;; vowel length: short long diphthong schwa
       (vlng s l d a 0)
       ;; vowel height: high mid low
       (vheight 1 2 3 -)
       ;; vowel frontness: front mid back
       (vfront 1 2 3 -)
       )
      ;; Phone set members (features are not! set properly)
      (
       (#  - 0 - - )
       (a  + l 3 1 )
       (u  + l 1 3 )
      )
    )
    (PhoneSet.silences '(#))

A phone set definition has the form

    (defPhoneSet
      NAME
      FEATUREDEFS
      PHONEDEFS )
    (PhoneSet.silences '(#))

## Lexicons

Create a new lexicon

    (lex.create "newname")

Declare a phone set for the lexicon.

    (lex.set.phoneset "mrpa")
