BENGLA NOTES

Festival does not support Unicode directly, so everything must first be transliterated into ASCII

Ideally get speech from a native consultant, but Forvo has many sound samples to get started. Files on Forvo have a Creative Commons license (CC BY-NC-SA 3.0).


Pronunciation lexicon

* Festival prefers elaborate lexicon over LTS rules.
* Letter-to-Sound (LTS) is very computationally intensive (in the Bangla language)
* But must develop LTS (or Grapheme-to-phoneme (G2P)) rules to handle loanwords/words not explicitly in lexicon.

Speech Database / Waveform Synthesis
 
* Concatenative synthesis is the most natural sound. 3 Techniques: diphone, unit selection, multisyn-unit selection.
** Diphone is unnatural, unit selection is more natural.
** Drawback of others is that a lot of data is needed. Approx 500-900 recorded utterances.
* Identify all features of phonemes and total number of phones. Using articulatory technique or acoustic technique. Acoustic technique is better.
* This implementation excluded diphthongs.
